    "The key physical concepts which specify the problem are the equation being solved (obviously), the spatial domain on which this equation is being solved, and the boundary conditions on that domain. The last of these is typically broken down into two varieties: \"Dirichlet\" boundary conditions, which specify the value of the field being solved for, and \"Neumann\" boundary conditions, which specify the gradient of that field dotted with the domain normal vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the important numerical concepts are the mesh generation (we will look in a bit of detail at the effect of mesh density) and the element order, which controls how the fields are interpolated within the individual elements (which we will touch on only briefly).\n",
