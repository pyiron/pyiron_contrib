"""
Channels are access points for information to flow into and out of nodes.

Data channels carry, unsurprisingly, data.
Output data channels will attempt to push their new value to all their connected input
data channels on update, while input data channels will reject any updates if their
parent node is running.
In this way, data channels facilitate forward propagation of data through a graph.
They hold data persistently.

Signal channels are tools for procedurally exposing functionality on nodes.
Input signal channels are connected to a callback function which gets invoked when the
channel is updated.
Output signal channels must be accessed by the owning node directly, and then trigger
all the input signal channels to which they are connected.
In this way, signal channels can force behaviour (node method calls) to propagate
forwards through a graph.
They do not hold any data, but rather fire for an effect.

class DataChannel(Channel, ABC):
    """
    Data channels control the flow of data on the graph.
    They store this data in a `value` attribute.
    They may optionally have a type hint.
    They have a `ready` attribute which tells whether their value matches their type
    hint (if one is provided, else `True`).
    (In the future they may optionally have a storage priority.)
    (In the future they may optionally have a storage history limit.)
    (In the future they may optionally have an ontological type.)

    The `value` held by a channel can be manually assigned, but should normally be set
    by the `update` method.
    In neither case is the type hint strictly enforced.

    Type hinting is strictly enforced in one situation: when making connections to
    other channels and at least one data channel has a non-None value for its type hint.
    In this case, we insist that the output type hint be _as or more more specific_ than
    the input type hint, to ensure that the input always receives output of a type it
    expects. This behaviour can be disabled and all connections allowed by setting
    `strict_connections = False` on the relevant input channel.

    For simple type hints like `int` or `str`, type hint comparison is trivial.
    However, some hints take arguments, e.g. `dict[str, int]` to specify key and value
    types; `tuple[int, int, str]` to specify a tuple with certain values;
    `typing.Literal['a', 'b', 'c']` to specify particular choices;
    `typing.Callable[[float, float], str]` to specify a callable that takes particular
    argument types and has a return type; etc.
    For hints with the origin `dict`, `tuple`, and `typing.Callable`, the two hints must
    have _exactly the same arguments_ for one two qualify as "as or more specific".
    E.g. `tuple[int, int|float]` is as or more specific than
    `tuple[int|float, int|float]`, but not `tuple[int, int|float, str]`.
    For _all other hints_, we demand that the output hint arguments be a _subset_ of
    the input.
    E.g. `Literal[1, 2]` is as or more specific that both `Literal[1, 2]` and
    `Literal[1, 2, "three"]`.

    The data `value` will initialize to an instance of `NotData` by default.
    The channel will identify as `ready` when the value is _not_ an instance of
    `NotData`, and when the value conforms to type hints (if any).

    Warning:
        Type hinting in python is quite complex, and determining when a hint is
        "more specific" can be tricky. For instance, in python 3.11 you can now type
        hint a tuple with a mixture of fixed elements of fixed type, followed by an
        arbitrary elements of arbitrary type. This and other complex scenarios are not
        yet included in our test suite and behaviour is not guaranteed.
