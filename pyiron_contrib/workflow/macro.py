class Macro(Composite):
    """
    A macro is a composite node that holds a graph with a fixed interface, like a
    pre-populated workflow that is the same every time you instantiate it.

    At instantiation, the macro uses a provided callable to build and wire the graph,
    then builds a static IO interface for this graph. (By default, unconnected IO is
    passed using the same formalism as workflows to combine node and channel names, but
    this can be overriden to rename the channels in the IO panel and/or to expose
    channels that already have an internal connection.)

    Like function nodes, initial values for input can be set using kwargs, and the node
    will (by default) attempt to update at the end of the instantiation process.

    It is intended that subclasses override the initialization signature and provide
    the graph creation directly from their own method.

    As with workflows, all DAG macros will determine their execution flow automatically,
    if you have cycles in your data flow, or otherwise want more control over the
    execution, all you need to do is specify the `node.signals.input.run` connections
    and `starting_nodes` list yourself.
    If only _one_ of these is specified, you'll get an error, but if you've provided
    both then no further checks of their validity/reasonableness are performed, so be
    careful.

    Examples:
        Let's consider the simplest case of macros that just consecutively add 1 to
        their input:
        >>> from pyiron_contrib.workflow.macro import Macro
        >>>
        >>> def add_one(x):
        ...     result = x + 1
        ...     return result
        >>>
        >>> def add_three_macro(macro):
        ...     macro.one = macro.create.SingleValue(add_one)
        ...     macro.two = macro.create.SingleValue(add_one, macro.one)
        ...     macro.three = macro.create.SingleValue(add_one, macro.two)
        ...     macro.one > macro.two > macro.three
        ...     macro.starting_nodes = [macro.one]

        In this case we had _no need_ to specify the execution order and starting nodes
        --it's just an extremely simple DAG after all! -- but it's done here to
        demonstrate the syntax.

        We can make a macro by passing this graph-building function (that takes a macro
        as its first argument, i.e. `self` from the macro's perspective) to the `Macro`
        class. Then, we can use it like a regular node! Just like a workflow, the
        io is constructed from unconnected owned-node IO by combining node and channel
        labels.
        >>> macro = Macro(add_three_macro)
        >>> out = macro(one__x=3)
        >>> out.three__result
        6

        If there's a particular macro we're going to use again and again, we might want
        to consider making a new child class of `Macro` that overrides the
        `graph_creator` arg such that the same graph is always created. We could
        override `__init__` the normal way, but it's even faster to just use
        `partialmethod`:
        >>> from functools import partialmethod
        >>> class AddThreeMacro(Macro):
        ...     def build_graph(self):
        ...         add_three_macro(self)
        ...
        ...     __init__ = partialmethod(
        ...         Macro.__init__,
        ...         build_graph,
        ...     )
        >>>
        >>> macro = AddThreeMacro()
        >>> macro(one__x=0).three__result
        3

        We can also nest macros, rename their IO, and provide access to
        internally-connected IO by inputs and outputs maps:
        >>> def nested_macro(macro):
        ...     macro.a = macro.create.SingleValue(add_one)
        ...     macro.b = macro.create.Macro(add_three_macro, one__x=macro.a)
        ...     macro.c = macro.create.SingleValue(
        ...         add_one, x=macro.b.outputs.three__result
        ...     )
        >>>
        >>> macro = Macro(
        ...     nested_macro,
        ...     inputs_map={"a__x": "inp"},
        ...     outputs_map={"c__result": "out", "b__three__result": "intermediate"},
        ... )
        >>> macro(inp=1)
        {'intermediate': 5, 'out': 6}

        Macros and workflows automatically generate execution flows when their data
        is acyclic.
        Let's build a simple macro with two independent tracks:
        >>> def modified_flow_macro(macro):
        ...     macro.a = macro.create.SingleValue(add_one, x=0)
        ...     macro.b = macro.create.SingleValue(add_one, x=0)
        ...     macro.c = macro.create.SingleValue(add_one, x=0)
        >>>
        >>> m = Macro(modified_start_macro)
        >>> m.outputs.to_value_dict()
        >>> m(a__x=1, b__x=2, c__x=3)
        {'a__result': 2, 'b__result': 3, 'c__result': 4}

        We can override which nodes get used to start by specifying the `starting_nodes`
        property.
        If we do this we also need to provide at least one connection among the run
        signals, but beyond that the code doesn't hold our hands.
        Let's use this and then observe how the `a` sub-node no longer gets run:
        >>> m.starting_nodes = [m.b]  # At least one starting node
        >>> m.b > m.c  # At least one run signal
        >>> m(a__x=1000, b__x=2000, c__x=3000)
        {'a__result': 2, 'b__result': 2001, 'c__result': 3001}

        Note how the `a` node is no longer getting run, so the output is not updated!
        Manually controlling execution flow is necessary for cyclic graphs (cf. the
        while loop meta-node), but best to avoid when possible as it's easy to miss
        intended connections in complex graphs.
