class Workflow(Composite):
    """
    Workflows are a dynamic composite node -- i.e. they hold and run a collection of
    nodes (a subgraph) which can be dynamically modified (adding and removing nodes,
    and modifying their connections).

    Nodes can be added to the workflow at instantiation or with dot-assignment later on.
    They are then accessible either under the `nodes` dot-dictionary, or just directly
    by dot-access on the workflow object itself.

    Using the `input` and `output` attributes, the workflow gives access to all the
    IO channels among its nodes which are currently unconnected.

    The `Workflow` class acts as a single-point-of-import for us;
    Directly from the class we can use the `create` method to instantiate workflow
    objects.
    When called from a workflow _instance_, any created nodes get their parent set to
    the workflow instance being used.

    Examples:
        We allow adding nodes to workflows in five equivalent ways:
        >>> from pyiron_contrib.workflow.workflow import Workflow
        >>>
        >>> def fnc(x=0):
        ...     return x + 1
        >>>
        >>> # (1) As *args at instantiation
        >>> n1 = Workflow.create.Function(fnc, label="n1")
        >>> wf = Workflow("my_workflow", n1)
        >>>
        >>> # (2) Being passed to the `add` method
        >>> wf.add(Workflow.create.Function(fnc, label="n2"))
        >>>
        >>> # (3) Calling `create` from the _workflow instance_ that will own the node
        >>> wf.create.Function(fnc, label="n3")  # Instantiating from add
        >>>
        >>> # (4) By attribute assignment (here the node can be created from the
        >>> # workflow class or instance and the end result is the same
        >>> wf.n4 = wf.create.Function(fnc, label="anyhow_n4_gets_used")
        >>>
        >>> # (5) By creating from the workflow class but specifying the parent kwarg
        >>> Workflow.create.Function(fnc, label="n5", parent=wf)

        By default, the node naming scheme is strict, so if you try to add a node to a
        label that already exists, you will get an error. This behaviour can be changed
        at instantiation with the `strict_naming` kwarg, or afterwards by assigning a
        bool to this property. When deactivated, repeated assignments to the same label
        just get appended with an index:
        >>> wf.strict_naming = False
        >>> wf.my_node = wf.create.Function(fnc, x=0)
        >>> wf.my_node = wf.create.Function(fnc, x=1)
        >>> wf.my_node = wf.create.Function(fnc, x=2)
        >>> print(wf.my_node.inputs.x, wf.my_node0.inputs.x, wf.my_node1.inputs.x)
        0, 1, 2

        The `Workflow` class is designed as a single point of entry for workflows, so
        you can also access decorators to define new node classes right from the
        workflow (cf. the `Node` docs for more detail on the node types).
        Let's use these to explore a workflow's input and output, which are dynamically
        generated from the unconnected IO of its nodes:
        >>> @Workflow.wrap_as.function_node("y")
        >>> def plus_one(x: int = 0):
        ...     return x + 1
        >>>
        >>> wf = Workflow("io_workflow")
        >>> wf.first = plus_one()
        >>> wf.second = plus_one()
        >>> print(len(wf.inputs), len(wf.outputs))
        2 2

        If we connect the output of one node to the input of the other, there are fewer
        dangling channels for the workflow IO to find:
        >>> wf.second.inputs.x = wf.first.outputs.y
        >>> print(len(wf.inputs), len(wf.outputs))
        1 1

        Then we just run the workflow
        >>> out = wf.run()

        The workflow joins node lavels and channel labels with a `_` character to
        provide direct access to the output:
        >>> print(wf.outputs.second__y.value)
        2

        These input keys can be used when calling the workflow to update the input. In
        our example, the nodes update automatically when their input gets updated, so
        all we need to do to see updated workflow output is update the input:
        >>> out = wf(first__x=10)
        >>> out
        {'second__y': 12}

        Note: this _looks_ like a dictionary, but has some extra convenience that we
        can dot-access data:
        >>> out.second__y
        12

        Workflows also give access to packages of pre-built nodes under different
        namespaces, e.g.
        >>> wf = Workflow("with_prebuilt")
        >>>
        >>> wf.structure = wf.create.atomistics.Bulk(
        ...     cubic=True,
        ...     name="Al"
        ... )
        >>> wf.engine = wf.create.atomistics.Lammps(structure=wf.structure)
        >>> wf.calc = wf.create.atomistics.CalcMd(
        ...     job=wf.engine,
        ... )
        >>> wf.plot = wf.create.standard.Scatter(
        ...     x=wf.calc.outputs.steps,
        ...     y=wf.calc.outputs.temperature
        ... )

        We can give more convenient names to IO, and even access IO that would normally
        be hidden (because it's connected) by specifying an `inputs_map` and/or
        `outputs_map`. In the example above, let's make the resulting figure a bit
        easier to find:
        >>> wf.outputs_map = {"plot__fig": "fig"}
        >>> wf().fig

        Workflows can be visualized in the notebook using graphviz:
        >>> wf.draw()

        The resulting object can be saved as an image, e.g.
        >>> wf.draw().render(filename="demo", format="png")

        When your workflow's data follows a directed-acyclic pattern, it will determine
        the execution flow automatically.
        If you want or need more control, you can set the `automate_execution` flag to
        `False` and manually specify an execution flow.
        Cf. the

    TODO: Workflows can be serialized.

    TODO: Once you're satisfied with how a workflow is structured, you can export it
        as a macro node for use in other workflows. (Maybe we should allow for nested
        workflows without exporting to a node? I was concerned then what happens to the
        nesting abstraction if, instead of accessing IO through the workflow's IO flags,
        a user manually connects IO from individual nodes from two different, nested or
        sibling workflows when those connections were _previously internal to their own
        workflow_. This seems very unsafe. Maybe there is something like a lock we can
        apply that falls short of a full export, but still guarantees the internal
        integrity of workflows when they're used somewhere else?
